GameFlow v1.2.6
----------------

GameFlow is a FREE visual scripting and automation tool designed to be easy to use and immediately useful for your Unity projects.

GameFlow is currently in maintenance mode which means no new features and only minimal updates just to ensure compatibility with new Unity versions. If you find GameFlow useful please consider becoming a patron so I can restore the normal development pace.


Installation
---------------

IMPORTANT: GameFlow only supports Unity LTS versions (2018.4, 2019.4, 2020.3) and 2021.x or newer, meaning that previous Unity versions are not supported at all. Please upgrade Unity before importing or updating the GameFlow package.

IMPORTANT: It is always recommended having your projects under version control or at least making a backup before importing a new version of any asset containing code.

If you downloaded GameFlow from the Unity Asset Store, the only required step is to import the package into your project in one of these two ways:

1) If you are creating a new project, just mark the checkbox "GameFlow" in the New Project window to get the package automatically imported.

2) If you need to import GameFlow into an existing project, log in the Asset Store (Window > Asset Store), Find the GameFlow package in "My Assets" and click on the Import button to get the package automatically imported into the current project.

If you downloaded GameFlow from itch.io you only need to find the .unitypackage inside the .zip file and import it manually into your project.

If you need further information on installation or the update process, please refer to the "Quick Start" chapter in the documentation: https://docs.evasiongames.com/installation


Troubleshooting
----------------

If you updated GameFlow while using a Unity version older than 2018.4 and you didn't make a copy of your project before the update, please don't panic and just contact support@evasiongames.com so we can send you the old version.

GameFlow requires .Net 4.x equivalent scripting runtime. If you are still lusing the .Net 3.5 equivalent (deprecated), please follow these instructions:

1. Click the Edit > Project Settings menu option.
2. Select the Player pane.
3. Unfold the 'Other Settings' section.
4. Find and change the Scripting Runtime Version setting.
5. Restart Unity.
